# ☕ Coffee Shop Sales Analysis & Forecasting  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes coffee shop sales data using **Machine Learning** and **Time-Series Forecasting**.  
It covers:  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Machine Learning model to predict daily revenue  
- Time-series forecasting (ARIMA) to predict next 30 days of sales  
- Business insights & recommendations for better decision-making

## 🚀 Features  
- **EDA & Visualization**: Identify peak sales hours, customer preferences, and revenue trends  
- **Machine Learning**: Regression model to predict sales  
- **Model Evaluation**: MAE, RMSE, and R² score for performance  
- **Time-Series Forecasting**: Predict future sales with ARIMA model  
- **Business Insights**: Actionable recommendations for growth
